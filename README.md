##Conway's Game of Life

I came across this old highschool project from 2011 while cleaning out a backup harddrive. Now it's available for the whole world to see. Hopefully I didn't make too many embarrassing mistakes or bad coding practices.

To try it out, just run:
> javac LifeSimulation

> java LifeSimulation
